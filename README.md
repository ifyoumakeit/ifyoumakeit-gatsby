# If You Make It

Rewriting the frontend of IYMI to move away from my original PHP version to a static site using Gatsby with Netlify for deploying/hosting. Currently IYMI uses a MySQL database hosted at HostGator, but I'm also looking into moving that to a tuned PostgreSQL DB hosted on cheaper hosting.
